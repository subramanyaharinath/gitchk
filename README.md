IIoT has changed the way condition based monitoring can be completed. Sensors installed on the assets can perform ongoing vibration and oil analysis, and monitor temperature changes. This greatly reduces the need for manual inspections and testing. Sensors will monitor the asset condition for indicators of decreasing performance or imminent failure. When indicators arise, the sensor will notify the maintenance team of the change in asset condition through an IIoT solution. Maintenance teams can respond to the issue and perform the necessary maintenance immediately.
One big advantage that Condition Based Monitoring offers is the ability to gain a better understanding of your asset health. Close observation and data analysis of the assets helps plant engineers get to know the unique quirks of each asset. Condition based monitoring helps maintenance teams make more informed decisions about performance optimization and maintenance needs. It also gives maintenance and reliability organizations the information they need to improve long-term asset health and to better their maintenance processes and practices.


For example, a certain piece of equipment usually vibrates at a given frequency. If that frequency starts to vary, or changes substantially, it could mean something is starting to fail or needs to be replaced. The sensors will register this change and notify the maintenance team of the potential issue so they can respond accordingly.

Overall benefits of condition based monitoring includes:

Increased uptime/reduced downtime
Reduction in/elimination of unplanned failures
Decreased maintenance costs
Increased asset life
Reduction in collateral asset damages
Greater ease in prioritization and planning of work orders
Increased efficiency in maintenance practices and management
Maintenance activities based on asset condition, rather than on a pre-set interval, has the potential to progress maintenance activities to a new level of efficiency. Monitoring asset health results in fewer failures which in turn results in improved equipment availability and more efficient operations for longer periods of time. Maintenance teams are more informed about their assets and can make more confident maintenance decisions. With advance warning of machine failures, unexpected breakdowns can be avoided with planned repairs, allowing more time to be spent on other priority areas such as asset performance, energy efficiency, production output, and more.



IIoT and Condition Based Monitoring allows maintenance teams to anticipate a potential failure and take action. Maintenance teams can take the asset down temporarily to prevent a major failure. It is better to be down for a short time to replace a worn part than to have a failure that requires an unknown amount of downtime.

The application of IIoT technology on condition based monitoring can reduce maintenance costs by up to 25%, cut unplanned outages by up to 50%, and extend the lives of machines by years.1
